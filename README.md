The assignment was to create a SQL Database to store product for sale as would an Amazon type e-tailer.
The MySQL Database is called bamazondb
A simple table of data with an item id, product name, department name, price of the product and the quantity in stock.

The Database is populated with 10 different products to shop for.
The bamazonCustomer.js node CLI application will allow you to see a list of the products available and choice which products they would like to purchase based on id.
The user can then select the quality and then make their purchase.

The CLI will allow the customer to quit out of the program by selecting the "q" key on their keyboard.

After making a purchase the application will update the database to reflect the remaining inventory of products.
